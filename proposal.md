# Major Project Proposal

## Description
- A Cooking style game inspired by the "Papa's" games

## Needs to Have
- 3 different orders
- At least 4 different parts of assembly (Cutting, Cooking, Assembling, Serving) all in one screen split into 4
- 
- Some form of introductory dialogue and sound effects.

## Nice to Have
- Timed aspect for orders that affect customer satisfaction and change with how "complex" the order is
- Mini Games for actions like cutting, cooking, etc.
- Nice images/sprites making it look realistic, maybe even having animated ones.
- Money being able to upgrade at least one appliance (makes it faster) 
- 
- Two different screens (Kitchen/Payment Counter)
